# 💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m currently working on projects involving network design, network security, routing & switching, and data-driven network solutions.<br><br>I’m looking for help with core CCNA concepts and data science foundations, including network design and configuration, routing and switching, IP addressing and subnetting, network security and troubleshooting, as well as data preprocessing, basic analytics, and applying data-driven approaches within networked systems.
<br><br>I’m currently learning CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) and Introduction to Data Science by Cisco, aiming to strengthen my networking, data analysis .<br><br>Ask me about networking basics, network configurations, and data-driven network solutions.<br><br>Fun fact:I enjoy exploring how computer networks are designed, configured, and optimized to ensure reliable connectivity, efficient data transmission, and secure communication, with a strong focus on CCNA-level concepts such as routing, switching, IP addressing, and network troubleshooting.
